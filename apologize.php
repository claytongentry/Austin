          <p>I don't think I got that message. Make sure your internet connection is
          steady and you filled out the form correctly.</p>
          <p>If you did both of those, it's probably my fault. Sorry about that!
          Just email me the old-fashioned way: <a href="mailto:claytongentry2017@u.northwestern.edu" style = "color: gray">claytongentry2017@u.northwestern.edu</a>.</p>
